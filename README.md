# X9-Security-Wordpress-Shell
**About**

To help the pentesting community, X9 Security is releasing the X9 Security Wordpress Shell as part of its ongoing shell project. We believe that the availability of these tools will lead to an ultimately more secure ecosystem. Previously pentesters, red teamers, and the like relied on in-house shells and other tools which would take time to build and maintain. The shell project aims to alleviate some of that burden by supplying easy to use shells for various platforms.

**Features**

 - Simple command passthrough 
 - URL File Upload 
 - PHP File Upload 
 - Netcat Shell
 - Meterpreter Shell
 - Socat Shell


**Installation**

Simply clone or download this repository, zip the files inside of the "x9-shell" directory, and upload the plugin onto a compromised Wordpress site. The shell can be accessed via the setting's menu under "Wordpress Shell".
